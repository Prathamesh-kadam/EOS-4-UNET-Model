# EOS-4-UNET-Model
Understanding polar ice dynamics and climate change impacts is vital for predicting global effects and preparing for sea level rise. Accurate classification of sea ice types using EOS-04 SAR data faces challenges like high variability, class imbalance, and poor minority class detection in segmentation models.


Code Availability Notice
This repository contains selected modules and scripts related to the polar sea ice segmentation project using the EOS-04 SAR dataset. To ensure reproducibility, core functionality such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.

Certain advanced algorithmic components and proprietary model optimization codes are currently withheld due to ongoing publication and intellectual property considerations. These components will be made available upon formal publication of the accompanying research article.

Access to Withheld Code
Collaborators, reviewers, or interested researchers seeking access to the full codebase during the peer review process or for academic purposes are encouraged to contact the corresponding author via email at [kprathamesh082@gmail.com]. Access may be granted under mutually agreed terms.

Future Updates
Following publication, the repository will be fully updated with all code, detailed documentation, and additional datasets (subject to redistribution agreements). Users will be notified via the repository announcements and publication links.

We appreciate your understanding and encourage contributions, bug reports, and questions on the publicly available portions of the code.
